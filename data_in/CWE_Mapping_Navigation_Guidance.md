# CWE Mapping & Navigation Guidance

## Mapping to CWE IDs â€“ Criteria for the Best Match

To determine whether you have found the best matching CWE ID for a particular weakness, consider the following:

- **Type of Entry:**  
  The entry should be a *Weakness* or *Composite/Chain type*.  
  - **Note:** Mapping to a **View** is incorrect, and mapping to a **Category** is strongly discouraged because categories are not centered around CWE's behavioral model of weaknesses.

- **Level of Abstraction:**  
  The entry should be at the **lowest level of abstraction possible** while still matching (or subsuming) the weakness concept you have in mind.  
  - Be aware that CWE cannot support every perspective or classification method. Sometimes there will be no suitable match except at a very high level; see the [Mapping Analysis](#) document for further discussion.
