* A Discussion on CWE View-1003 
“Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published Vulnerabilities” 

## 2024 CWE Top 25 Update 
* 2024 CWE Top 25 dataset (i.e., CVE Records' CWE mappings) have been divided into batches and distributed to CNAs for review[cite: 3].
* Team has been receiving feedback, mapping reviews (e.g., blanket approvals, intention not to participate, detailed reviews/feedback)[cite: 3].
* Stats: 
    * 9,901 requested CVE reviews[cite: 3].
    * 3,737 CVEs were declined from participation[cite: 3].
    * 1,650 CVEs have been received so far (17%)[cite: 3].
* For CVE Records with no response, we will use the current available mappings[cite: 3].



## CWE View-1003: Weaknesses for Simplified Mapping of Published Vulnerabilities 
* Meant to be helpful when starting mapping[cite: 4].
* NVD maps to strictly CWEs in this view[cite: 4].
* Vulnogram appears to only allow CWEs in this view[cite: 4].
* This view is not meant to constrain which CWEs are allowed to be mapped to[cite: 4].
* Always use the most precise and specific CWE when possible[cite: 4].


## View-1003 problematic example 
* Product allows HTTP request splitting[cite: 5].
    * **Best Mapping**: CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting’)[cite: 5].
        * This is a variant and not in View-1003[cite: 5].
    * **If following View-1003, you would be forced to map to the closest parent**: CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection’)[cite: 5].
        * While the general idea of the root cause weakness is still tracked, it does not capture specific details of the weakness which might be useful for analysis[cite: 5].
